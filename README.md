# Inventory My Home

### A functional App to give you piece of mind when moving or filing an insurance claim

Using this application you will have the ability to easily and quickly create a list of everything in your home, organized how you like, and referencable from anywhere.

When my home was broken in to several years ago, one of the biggest questions I had trouble answering was, "is anything missing?"  Such a simple question, but one I had trouble with.  I created this app to give yourself both a reminder of what you have and also an easy way to back up that information with an insurance company should a claim need to be filed.

This system is also incredibly useful for moves, making it easy to keep track of where your things are without having to worry about keeping track of lists on paper.
