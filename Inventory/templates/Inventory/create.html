    <h3>Add a New List</h3>

    <p>You can name your lists whatever you like, but our suggestion is to use the "container" type of whatever Inventory you are creating.  Preparing for a move?  Maybe label the list with a box number you also write on the box.  Just doing your home?  We recommend the name to be the room the items are in.  You could also make a list for just the electronics in your house and name it that, it really is up to you.</p>
